# CountryEnumeration
Mendix Country enumeration module for Mx 5.21.1

This module will update or create an ISO based country enumeration table with flag icons confrom ISO 3166-1. 
It provides all current 249 countries with the Alpha-2 code, Alpha-3 code and numeric code.

Translations are provided for the Dutch, Netherlands and English, United States language settings. To use the module make sure that you connect the CountryModuleOverview form from the _UseMe directory to your navigation. 

As an example the nationalities are also provided for a small number of countries with the translation in Dutch and English.
A next update will provide all the nationalities and will incorporate the Dutch NEN1888 table. 
If you have a standard nationality table of your country (like the Dutch NEN1888 table) please provide this to us so whe
can incorporate this table in future version. Area codes (telephone codes) are also on the roadmap. Only the groundwork has been done.

Since this data table is quite large we can not be held responsible for data mistakes. If you find any please report so 
the module can be updated.
